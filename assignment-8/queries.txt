///Step 1: Create Table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER,
    course TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

///Step 2: Insert Data (7 Records)
INSERT INTO students (name, email, age, course)
VALUES
('Aarav Sharma', 'aarav@gmail.com', 21, 'Computer Science'),
('Diya Patel', 'diya@gmail.com', 19, 'Mathematics'),
('Rohan Verma', 'rohan@gmail.com', 23, 'Physics'),
('Sneha Singh', 'sneha@gmail.com', 20, 'Computer Science'),
('Kabir Khan', 'kabir@gmail.com', 22, 'Data Science'),
('Ananya Gupta', 'ananya@gmail.com', 18, 'Mathematics'),
('Mohit Jain', 'mohit@gmail.com', 25, 'Physics');

//Step 3: Read Data (SELECT Queries)
1️-- Fetch all students
SELECT * FROM students;

2️-- Fetch students older than 20
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;

3️-- Fetch only name and email
SELECT name, email FROM students;

4️-- Fetch students enrolled in a specific course (Computer Science)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'Computer Science';

Step 4: Update Data
1️--Update age of one student (Diya → 19 → 20)
UPDATE students
SET age = 20
WHERE name = 'Diya Patel';
2️--- Update course for all students enrolled in Physics → Data Analytics
UPDATE students
SET course = 'Data Analytics'
WHERE course = 'Physics';


Step 5: Delete Data
1️-- Delete one student using id (example: delete id = 3)
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 3;

2️--Delete all students below age 19
DELETE FROM students
WHERE age < 19;
